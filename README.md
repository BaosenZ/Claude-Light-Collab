# A distributed data sharing collaboration to build a digital twin of Claude-Light

Dr. John Kitchin from Carnegie Mellon University recently described [Claude-Light](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0266757) (a REST API accessible Raspberry Pi that controls an RGB LED with a photometer that measures ten spectral outputs) as a lightweight, remotely accessible instrument for exploring the idea of self-driving laboratories. 

We participate in a distributed collaboration to build a digital twin of Claude-Light. The goals are:
1. Demonstrate a distributed collaboration on a remotely automated instrument
2. Demonstrate a data-sharing mechanism through a set of cloud databases
3. Develop a digital twin of Claude-Light

This repository demonstrates how I collaborate within our team to share the databases and build the final models of digital twin of Claude-Light.
